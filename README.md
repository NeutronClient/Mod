### Why Should You Use Our Client Over Others?
#### NeutronMc stands out because our code is entirely public. Anyone can contribute to its development, and we ensure that all code is thoroughly reviewed before being merged into the client. You have full transparency and can inspect the entire codebase if you wish.
#### The client was originally created in response to concerns about the popular client FeatherMc, which had some questionable aspects.
#### Can you create forks of this mod?
Yes, but only for private use.
We don't want people to monetize or put malware in the mod and distributing it
